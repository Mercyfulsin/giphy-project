# giphy-project
In this project, the user is able to click on buttons to grab 10-50 Gif's from Giphy's database. The Gif's are displayed as still images initially and can be toggled to animate when they are clicked. Users are also able to add their own search query as a button. The list of buttons persists with the use of local storage.
